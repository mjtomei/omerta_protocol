Identity Rotation Attack Simulation

Simulates Attack Class 6: Identity Rotation / Spotlight Evasion
with and without the new defense mechanisms:
- Transfer burns (trust-based)
- Amount-based transfer burns
- Trust inheritance on transfer
- Circular flow detection

Key scenario: Wealthy user W is under scrutiny (low effective trust despite
high raw trust). W creates puppet P, invests time to build P's trust, then
transfers wealth to P to escape the spotlight.

1. TRUST INHERITANCE IS THE KEY DEFENSE
   - Without defenses: P keeps their earned trust ({results_no_defense['p_trust_after_transfer']:.0f})
   - With defenses: P's trust drops to match W's ({results_with_defense['p_trust_after_transfer']:.0f})
   - Trust reduction: {trust_reduction:.0f}%

2. THE SPOTLIGHT FOLLOWS THE MONEY
   - Without defenses: P has trust {results_no_defense['p_effective_trust_final']:.0f} vs W's {results_no_defense['w_effective_trust']:.0f} → EVADES SPOTLIGHT
   - With defenses: P has trust {results_with_defense['p_effective_trust_final']:.0f} vs W's {results_with_defense['w_effective_trust']:.0f} → SPOTLIGHT FOLLOWS

3. MULTI-PUPPET DOESN'T HELP
   - Each puppet that receives money inherits W's reputation
   - Distributing across multiple puppets just means multiple puppets with low trust

4. AMOUNT-BASED BURNS ADD ADDITIONAL COST
   - Large transfers (500× median) incur extra ~{K_AMOUNT * math.log(501) / math.log(AMOUNT_SCALE) * 100:.0f}% burn
   - Makes repeated rotation progressively more expensive
