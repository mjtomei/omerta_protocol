# Transaction 01: Cabal Attestation

Witnesses (cabal) verify VM allocation, monitor session, and attest to service delivery.

**See also:** [Protocol Format](../../FORMAT.md) for primitive operations and state machine semantics.

## Overview

After escrow is locked (Transaction 00), the provider allocates a VM and notifies the cabal. The cabal verifies the VM is accessible via wireguard to both the consumer and the cabal members. This attestation is required for settlement.

**Actors:**
- **Provider** - allocates VM, notifies cabal of allocation and termination
- **Consumer** - connects to VM, uses service
- **Cabal (Witnesses)** - verify VM accessibility, can vote to abort, attest to session delivery

**Flow:**
1. Provider allocates VM, connects to consumer and cabal wireguards
2. Provider sends VM_ALLOCATED to cabal with connection details
3. Cabal members verify wireguard connectivity to VM
4. Cabal can vote to abort (return deposit) if verification fails
5. Session runs, burn rate accrues
6. Provider sends VM_CANCELLED when session ends (by either party or fault)
7. Cabal creates attestation of actual session duration and termination reason

## Parameters

```omt
parameters (
    # Verification timeouts
    VM_ALLOCATION_TIMEOUT = 300 seconds "Provider must allocate VM within 5 min of lock"
    CONNECTIVITY_CHECK_TIMEOUT = 60 seconds "Witnesses must verify connectivity within 1 min"
    CONNECTIVITY_VOTE_TIMEOUT = 30 seconds "Time to collect connectivity votes"
    ABORT_VOTE_TIMEOUT = 30 seconds "Time to collect abort votes"

    # Monitoring parameters
    MONITORING_CHECK_INTERVAL = 60 seconds "Periodic VM health check interval"
    MISUSE_INVESTIGATION_TIMEOUT = 120 seconds "Time to investigate misuse accusation"

    # Thresholds
    CONNECTIVITY_THRESHOLD = 0.67 fraction "Fraction of witnesses that must verify connectivity"
    ABORT_THRESHOLD = 0.67 fraction "Fraction needed to abort session"
    ATTESTATION_THRESHOLD = 3 count "Minimum witnesses for valid attestation"

    # Witness selection parameters
    WITNESS_COUNT = 5 count "Number of witnesses (from escrow lock)"

)
```

## Settlement Conditions

From [Protocol Format](../../FORMAT.md#settlement-conditions):

| Condition | Escrow Action | Trust Signal |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **COMPLETED_NORMAL** | Full release per burn formula | Trust credit for provider |
| **CONSUMER_TERMINATED_EARLY** | Pro-rated partial release | Neutral (consumer's choice) |
| **PROVIDER_TERMINATED** | No release for remaining time | Reliability signal (tracked) |
| **SESSION_FAILED** | Investigate if pattern emerges | No automatic penalty |

## Consumer Misbehavior Handling

Consumer misbehavior is limited by design:
- Provider owns the compute (can terminate at will)
- Compute is ephemeral (nothing persists after termination)
- Timeouts prevent indefinite resource consumption
- No consumer signature required - if consumer connects but doesn't acknowledge, cabal can still attest and provider gets paid

**Misuse accusation flow:**
1. Provider suspects consumer misuse (e.g., mining crypto on CPU instance)
2. Provider notifies cabal with evidence
3. Cabal members can observe connection from inside VM (ssh over wireguard)
4. If misuse confirmed, session terminated with CONSUMER_MISUSE reason
5. Provider retains payment for time used

---

## Verification Requirements

For attestation to be valid:
1. `VM_ALLOCATED` must reference valid `LOCK_RESULT` from Transaction 00
2. At least THRESHOLD witnesses must sign `CABAL_ATTESTATION`
3. `actual_duration_seconds` must be ≤ time between `allocated_at` and `cancelled_at`
4. Termination reason must be one of the valid enum values

---

## Attack Analysis

TODO: Add attack analysis following template in FORMAT.md

---

## Open Questions

1. How do witnesses verify wireguard connectivity without being able to use the VM?
2. What constitutes "consumer misuse" and how is it proven?
3. How long do witnesses wait before voting to abort on connectivity failure?
4. Should there be periodic re-attestation during long sessions?
